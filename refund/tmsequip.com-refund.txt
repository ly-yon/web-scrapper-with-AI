Shipping, Receiving & Returns


    

    
            Shipping:
We can ship globally, with certain product restrictions for international destinations. Shipping and delivery dates are estimated based on item availability and chosen shipping options. Shipping rates are calculated based on item value and weight. If you'd like to use your shipping account, please provide the details in the order instructions, and we'll adjust the invoice accordingly.
Receiving Packages:
Inspect packages for quantity and damage before signing. Note any damage on the shipment (BOL) and ensure you have all packages if indicated as multiple. Signing for a shipment without noting issues eliminates the option for a freight claim or reimbursement for damaged or missing items.
Returns Policy:
Returns are accepted within 20 days, subject to a 20% restocking fee issued as store credit. Eligible items must be unused, in original packaging, and worth more than $35.00.
Certain items, such as hazardous materials, flammable liquids, gases, seal kits, and electrical parts, cannot be returned. 
Partial refunds may apply in specific situations, like items not in original condition or returned over 20 days after delivery.
To initiate a return, log in to your account, view the order, and click the "Return Item(s)" button.
Once the return is requested, there is an authorization period where the return must be authorized, this can take a few days and an email will be sent with instructions to the account email once authorized.
Refund notifications will be sent via email after processing the returned item.
Please do not send your purchase back to the manufacturer without our instructions to do so.
