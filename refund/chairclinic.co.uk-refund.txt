Here at The Chair Clinic Ltd we pride ourselves on excellent customer service.
We know that you don't want to wait days for your order to arrive, that's why we send every component order within the UK Mainland by Royal Mail or TNT. This means that all being well, you should receive your parcel the following working day after it has been despatched, or within 5 days.
However, although we promise to despatch your order quickly, it should be remembered that delivery is not guaranteed within this timescale and parcels can occasionally take longer to reach their destinations. Parcels sent to Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, Isles of Scilly, the Channel Islands, certain parts of Scotland, Europe and the rest of the world will usually take a little longer to arrive.
All shipping charges quoted are for UK mainland destinations only, delivery to Channel Islands, Scottish Highlands & Islands, Northern Ireland, EU and the rest of the world may incur further shipping costs.
