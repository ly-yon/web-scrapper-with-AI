Return Policy
We accept returns within 30 days of the original purchase date, for garments in their original packaging with all tags attached. Products that do not have the original packaging or show signs of wear will not be refunded, and will be returned to sender at the customer’s expense. All return shipping charges will be the customers responsibility.  You should expect to receive your refund within 3 weeks of sending back your item, however, in many cases you will receive a refund more quickly. This time period includes the transit time for us to receive your return, the time it takes us to process your return once received (3 to 5 business days), and the time it takes your bank to process our refund request.

If you are located in the US please ship the return by United States Postal Service to the address at the bottom of the form. (Do not use UPS or Fed EX because of large cross border duty fees for those carriers.) 
Once we receive your return we will process your refund.
