Returns and Shipping Information
    
        Returns:
Returns cannot be accepted without prior authorization. Special Order items are made to a customer's requested specifications, and are, therefore, not returnable.   Items, other than Special Order, must be returned within 30 days of delivery and may be subject to a 20% restocking fee.  Shipping costs are not refundable.  Items must be returned in their original condition, and packaging.
Please contact Customer Service for a Return Authorization (RA) and shipping instructions. Send an email request to Customer Service at:  info@mimasofwarwick.com. 
 
Shipping:
 When you place an order, we will estimate shipping and delivery dates for you based on the availability of your items and the shipping options you choose. Depending on the shipping provider you choose, shipping date estimates may appear on the shipping quotes page. If choosing UPS for shipping, please note that UPS will not deliver to a P.O. Box address. Please also note that the shipping rates for many items we sell are weight-based. The weight of any such item can be found on its detail page. To reflect the policies of the shipping companies we use, all weights will be rounded up to the next full pound.
Shipping Options:  In order to keep shipping charges and in-transit damage to a minimum, restrictions apply to the following products:

Zulugrass- only single-strand purchases can fit and be shipped in a padded envelope.


John Michael Richardson items can only be shipped via USPS Priority Mail Flat-Rate Box.


Ruth Doron items returned for repair are subject to a $10.00 fee to offset the cost of shipping and insurance to Israel.  There is no charge for repairs.
