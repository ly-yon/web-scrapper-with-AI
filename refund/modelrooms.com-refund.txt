90 Day No Quibble Returns Policy
At Modelrooms we love to buy stuff online, so we also know that it can be a bit stressful at times trying to figure out exactly what the quality of the product is like. We are so sure that you will love your kit even more once it is in your hands that we are happy to offer a 90 day, no quibble, full refund, on any item that has not been used. You will be able to open the box and look inside, you can even feel the quality of the template pieces before you decide to keep it and create a plan.
Be warned though no one who opens the box can resist using the kit, which is why we offer the 90 day refund…almost no one takes us up on it…honestly.
You may return any new, unopened item within 90 days of delivery for a full refund. We offer a refund of the original shipping (shipping to you) as standard. We will pay the return shipping cost if the return is because of an error on our part (wrong item sent or a defect in the product).
You should expect to receive your refund within 15 days of our receipt of your package, though in many cases you will receive a refund more quickly. This time period includes the time it takes us to process your return once we receive it (3 to 5 business days), and the time it takes your bank to process our refund request (5 to 10 business days).If you need to return an item, simply drop us an email to: info@modelrooms.com and let us know.
We’ll notify you via e-mail of your refund once we’ve received and processed the returned item.
