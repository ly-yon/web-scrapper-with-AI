        Terms & Conditions


    

    
            Cowbell Central will never store credit card information that is provided when processing an order. Cowbell Central has no access to credit card information because that is processed through third party merchant banks, Braintree or Paypal, whichever is chosen during checkout. Customers who chose to create a Cowbell Central account will only have billing address, shipping address, and order history saved in their account.
Return Policy: Cowbell Central will work with customers on returns of defective merchandise. If a cowbell was shipped defective, it will be replaced at no cost to the customer. If a cowbell weld seam breaks within 1 year of purchase, a replacement will be shipped upon photo evidence. New clackers will be shipped to replace broken clackers at no extra charge as long as the cowbell was bought from Cowbell Central in the last 5 years. Customers wanting to return a cowbell that is NOT defective will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
