Limitation of Liability. COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR LOST PROFITS, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES. 


Medical Disclaimer. Company shall not be responsible for any liabilities arising out of the failure of Customer to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Customer shall ensure that all Products, whether purchased from Company or a third party, are maintained in accordance with manufacturer guidelines and in accordance with local and state laws, to the extent applicable. This includes properly maintaining AED units, conducting regular readiness checks, and ensuring AED equipment has current electrode pads and batteries. Nothing herein shall imply that Company will be responsible or liable for Customer’s failure to properly manage and maintain its AED equipment. Many AEDs require a prescription to purchase. Company provides prescriptions free-of-charge where applicable and includes a copy with your order. The prescription facilitates the purchase of your AED, but may not meet all federal, state, or local requirements for deploying the AED on your premises. By accepting the prescription(s) and AED, you agree to be responsible for complying with all legal requirements for AED placement. This includes, but is not limited to, medical control and oversight, ongoing CPR/AED training, event review, policy and procedure updates, equipment maintenance, and ongoing AED program compliance. Some states require those who purchase AEDs to obtain medical direction and oversight for their AED programs to quality for benefits of local Good Samaritan laws. Upon request, Company has compliance assistance programs with respect to such laws.


EEO Compliance. Customer agrees to comply with all federal, state and local laws respecting discrimination in employment and non-segregation of facilities including, but not limited to, requirements set out at 41 CFR 60 – 1.4. Customer shall abide by the requirements of 41 CFR 60-300.5(a). This regulation prohibits discrimination against qualified veterans, and requires affirmative action by covered prime contractors and subcontractors to employ and advance in employment qualified protected veterans. Customer shall abide by the requirements of 41 CFR 60-741.5(a). This regulation prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals on the basis of disability, and requires affirmative action by covered prime contractors and subcontractors to employ and advance in employment qualified individuals with disabilities. 


Force Majeure. In the event that either party is prevented from performing or is unable to perform any of its obligations under the Contract Documents (other than payment of amounts due hereunder) due to any Act of God, fire, casualty, flood, war, strike, lockout, epidemic, destruction of facilities, riot, insurrection, or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of the party invoking this Section, such party’s performance shall be excused and the time for the performance shall be extended for the period of the delay or inability to perform due to such occurrences.


Waiver of Jury Trial. CUSTOMER AGREES TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE A JURY PARTICIPATE IN THE RESOLUTION OF THE DISPUTE OR CLAIM, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, BETWEEN ANY OF THE PARTIES OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED WITH, RELATED TO OR INCIDENTAL TO THIS AGREEMENT.


Governing Law. These Standard Terms and Conditions will be governed by and construed in accordance with the applicable laws of Ohio, without giving effect to the principles of that State relating to conflicts of laws. Each party irrevocably agrees that any legal action, suit or proceeding brought by it in any way arising out of this Agreement must be brought solely and exclusively in, and will be subject to the service of process and other applicable procedural rules of, the state or federal courts in Columbus, Ohio.


Miscellaneous. No course of dealing between the parties or any waiver of a breach of any provision of the Contract Documents shall constitute a waiver of any other breach of such provision. Should any provision of the Contract Documents be held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining terms will remain in full force and effect, consistent with the terms of the Contract Documents taken as a whole. Each party shall be deemed an independent contractor of the other. Neither party shall be deemed an agent of the other.
