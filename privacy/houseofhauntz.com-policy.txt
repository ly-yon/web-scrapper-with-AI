How the Financial Incentive is Reasonably Related to the Value of Your Personal Information
The financial incentive or price difference is reasonably related to the value provided by your Personal Information. We take into consideration, without limitation, the anticipated revenue generated from such information, the anticipated expenses which we might incur in the collection, storage, and use of such information, and the anticipated expenses which we might incur related to the offer, provision, and imposition of any financial incentive or price difference. Based on this analysis, the value of your Personal Information that allows us to make these offers and financial incentives is the value of the offer itself.
Shine the Light Law
If you are a California resident, California Civil Code § 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by us to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes (as those terms are defined in that statute).
